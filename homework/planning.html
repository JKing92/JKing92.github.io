        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience of this website is the average man or woman in a town or small city. They will be middle class people of varying education, from a high school degree to a bachelors. This website will be something built for families. It is intended for people who don't have a lot of time, but who need to know their local weather to prepare for their day. That way, they can dress appropriately or plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>The user will access this website through any device, but will most likely use it at home. Someone who is checking their phone or computer quickly before leaving for the day will not have an excessive amount of time to spend looking about weather across the nation, so the website will need to keep things relatively simple and straightforward. The website needs to reflect that, keeping the complicated and international things that aren't important to them at the moment kept away from main pages.</p>

        <p>I had R.J. Stawinski review my sketches. He liked the layout but suggested that I add a search bar for all three designs and a magnifying glass for the tablet and smartphone modes. He said that otherwise it looked great. A search bar is definitely a good idea, and something I should have thought of initially. I decided imediately to add it to my initial designs. You can see in the following designs that a search bar has been added to each one.</p>
