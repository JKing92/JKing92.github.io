                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>Amazon's demographic has such a large range, that the target audience could be literally anyone.</p>

                <p>This site met the needs of the visitor by offering a large variety of products that can be sent to the customer without them needing to go to a store. There is a simple and easy to use design without too much clutter, so for those who are busy or do not have enough time to go outand look for what they need, they can find it easily here.</p>

                <p>This site has clearly labeled categories and an easy to find search bar with good option. Each item is clearly separated and has a summary that includes everything a user needs to know about the products the user is lookng at. You can easily search for items based on common requirements, such as user rating, price, and more so that the user knows exactly what it is that they're looking at.</p>

                <p>The website is completely reformatted for mobile devices. Instead of just shrinking their website, they created a new layout. Things are simpler, with enough white space to make sure the user isn't overwhelmed. It doesn't even require scorlling to the side to see the entire page, which is something many other websites do. This element alone greatly enhances the user experiences.</p>

                <h1>Site Contrast</h1>

                <h2>arngren.net</h2>

                <p>URL: <a href="https://www.arngren.net">https://www.arngren.net</a>
                </p>

                <p>Arngran doesn't seem to know who their target audience is. The site is so scattered with such a large range of items, that no sense can be made at all of it.</p>

                <p>Because of the confusion presented in the web site, they could never meet the needs of their audience. Even if the product a user is looking for is present on the site, the difficulty in finding it would frustrate most users to the point that they wouldn't want to use the site anyway.</p>

                <p>The site lacks any form of organization. In fact, the products on the main web site aren't even presented in rows or columns.</p>

                <p>The site looks exactly the same on a mobile device. In fact, to even be able to read anything, you have to zoom in significantly.</p>
